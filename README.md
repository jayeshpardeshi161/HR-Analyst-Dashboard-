## üéØ Project Goals
- Analyze employee attrition across multiple dimensions (age, gender, department, education, etc.)
- Provide visual insights into employee satisfaction and attrition trends
- Build a self-service dashboard for HR teams to track KPIs in real time

---

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
- **File**: `HR Data.csv`
- **Rows**: 1,470
- **Columns**: 39
- **Key Columns**: `Age`, `Attrition`, `Department`, `Gender`, `JobSatisfaction`, `EducationField`, `EmployeeCount`

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Employee attrition is costly and disruptive. This dashboard aims to uncover the key factors that contribute to attrition and present actionable insights for HR management to improve employee retention and engagement.

## üßÆ KPIs & Tableau Calculated Fields

To build the core metrics, I created custom calculated fields within Tableau to derive the following KPIs:

| **Metric Name**      | **Tableau Calculated Field**                     | **Purpose**                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attrition Count**  | `IF [Attrition] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`       | To quantify the number of employees who have left the organization.         |
| **Attrition Rate**   | `SUM([Attrition Count]) / SUM([Employee Count])` | To measure the proportion of employees who left out of the total workforce. |
| **Active Employees** | `SUM([Employee Count]) - SUM([Attrition Count])` | To calculate the number of employees currently active within the company.   |
| **Average Age**      | `AVG([Age])`                                     | To determine the average age of the workforce, helping identify age trends. |

## üîç EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Steps

| üîç **EDA Step**                                                   | **What I Did**                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distribution of employee age and gender**                       | I examined the age and gender distribution to understand the demographic makeup of the workforce.             |
| **Correlation between job satisfaction and attrition**            | I analyzed how job satisfaction levels relate to attrition rates to identify potential drivers.               |
| **Attrition rates by department, education field, and age group** | I calculated attrition rates across departments, education fields, and age brackets to find areas of concern. |
| **Job roles with high attrition rates**                           | I identified specific job roles experiencing the highest attrition, helping to focus retention efforts.       |
| **Gender distribution across departments**                        | I explored how gender is distributed within departments to detect any imbalance or trends.                    |

## üß† Data Modeling 

| üß† **Data Modeling Step**                             | **What I Did**                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculated Fields for KPIs**                        | I created calculated fields to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to attrition analysis. |
| **Grouping age into bins (e.g., 20‚Äì30, 30‚Äì40, etc.)** | I grouped age data into defined bins to simplify analysis and identify trends across age ranges.          |
| **Data filters by gender, department, and age group** | I applied filters for gender, department, and age group to enable interactive exploration of the data.    |
| **Data blending not required (single dataset)**       | I worked with a single, clean dataset, so data blending was not necessary for this analysis.              |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Higher attrition rates in younger age groups (20‚Äì30)**           | I observed that employees aged 20‚Äì30 experience significantly higher attrition rates compared to older age groups.                      |
| **Specific departments show elevated attrition**                   | I identified certain departments with notably higher attrition, indicating potential issues in role demands or work environment.        |
| **Lower job satisfaction is directly tied to increased attrition** | I found a strong negative correlation between job satisfaction and attrition‚Äîemployees with low satisfaction were more likely to leave. |
| **Gender-based differences in attrition for specific age bands**   | I noticed that attrition patterns vary by gender within specific age groups, highlighting a need for tailored retention strategies.     |

## üìå Insights & Inference

| üìå **Insight / Inference**                                                                       | **What I Concluded**                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attrition is not evenly distributed‚Äîage, department, and job satisfaction are strong drivers** | I concluded that attrition is concentrated in specific age groups and departments, with low job satisfaction being a key contributing factor. |
| **Intervening early with targeted employee programs could reduce attrition rates**               | I inferred that implementing targeted programs early‚Äîespecially for at-risk groups‚Äîcan help mitigate attrition.                               |
| **Dashboards help stakeholders monitor and react to workforce dynamics in real-time**            | I recognized that interactive dashboards provide stakeholders with timely insights, enabling proactive decision-making.                       |

Attrition Rate, Active Employees, and Avg. Age computed via appropriate Tableau formulas

Grouping by Age bins and Education Field

üëç Efficient use of calculated fields‚Äîhelps maintain data integrity and dynamic KPIs.

üëç Age binning adds more interpretability to trends.

---

### üìä 3. Visualization Review
You used a variety of visual tools:

KPI Cards: Clear and prominent for leadership.

Pie Chart: Department-wise attrition is visual and easy to digest.

Bar Charts: Strong use for education, age groups, and satisfaction ratings.
