## üßÆ KPIs & Tableau Calculated Fields

To build the core metrics, I created custom calculated fields within Tableau to derive the following KPIs:

| **Metric Name**      | **Tableau Calculated Field**                     | **Purpose**                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attrition Count**  | `IF [Attrition] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`       | To quantify the number of employees who have left the organization.         |
| **Attrition Rate**   | `SUM([Attrition Count]) / SUM([Employee Count])` | To measure the proportion of employees who left out of the total workforce. |
| **Active Employees** | `SUM([Employee Count]) - SUM([Attrition Count])` | To calculate the number of employees currently active within the company.   |
| **Average Age**      | `AVG([Age])`                                     | To determine the average age of the workforce, helping identify age trends. |

## üîç EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Steps

| üîç **EDA Step**                                                   | **What I Did**                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distribution of employee age and gender**                       | I examined the age and gender distribution to understand the demographic makeup of the workforce.             |
| **Correlation between job satisfaction and attrition**            | I analyzed how job satisfaction levels relate to attrition rates to identify potential drivers.               |
| **Attrition rates by department, education field, and age group** | I calculated attrition rates across departments, education fields, and age brackets to find areas of concern. |
| **Job roles with high attrition rates**                           | I identified specific job roles experiencing the highest attrition, helping to focus retention efforts.       |
| **Gender distribution across departments**                        | I explored how gender is distributed within departments to detect any imbalance or trends.                    |

## üß† Data Modeling 

| üß† **Data Modeling Step**                             | **What I Did**                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculated Fields for KPIs**                        | I created calculated fields to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to attrition analysis. |
| **Grouping age into bins (e.g., 20‚Äì30, 30‚Äì40, etc.)** | I grouped age data into defined bins to simplify analysis and identify trends across age ranges.          |
| **Data filters by gender, department, and age group** | I applied filters for gender, department, and age group to enable interactive exploration of the data.    |
| **Data blending not required (single dataset)**       | I worked with a single, clean dataset, so data blending was not necessary for this analysis.              |
